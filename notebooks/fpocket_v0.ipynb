        "This tutorial aims to illustrate the process of **protein-ligand docking**, step by step, using the **BioExcel Building Blocks library (biobb)**. The particular example used is the **Mitogen-activated protein kinase 14** (p38-α) protein (PDB code [3HEC](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3HEC), [https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb3HEC/pdb](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb3HEC/pdb)), a well-known **Protein Kinase enzyme**,\n",
        " in complex with the FDA-approved **Imatinib**, (PDB Ligand code [STI](https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/STI), DrugBank Ligand Code [DB00619](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00619)), a small molecule **kinase inhibitor** used to treat certain types of **cancer**.\n",

        "Please note that **docking algorithms**, and in particular, **AutoDock Vina** program used in this tutorial, are **non-deterministic**. That means that results obtained when running the workflow **could be diferent** from the ones we obtained during the writing of this tutorial (see [AutoDock Vina manual](http://vina.scripps.edu/manual.html)). We invite you to try the docking process several times to verify this behaviour.\n",
